# ITE311 Laboratory Activity - Unified Dashboard Implementation

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

Your ITE311-VISAYAS project has successfully implemented all requirements for the Laboratory Activity on Unified Dashboard with Role-Based Access Control.

### Step 1: Project Setup ✅
- **Database Structure**: Users table with role column (admin, teacher, student)
- **Migration Status**: All migrations are up to date
- **Test Users**: Three test accounts created with different roles
- **Server Setup**: CodeIgniter project properly configured

### Step 2: Login Process for Unified Dashboard ✅

- ✅ Proper authentication and session management
- ✅ Redirect logic: `return redirect()->to(base_url('dashboard'));`

### Step 3: Enhanced Dashboard Method ✅
**File**: `app/Controllers/Auth.php` (lines 107-188)

- ✅ Admin data: Total users, courses, recent activities
- ✅ Teacher data: Course management, notifications, student counts
- ✅ Student data: Enrolled courses, available courses, grades, deadlines
- ✅ User role and data passed to view

### Step 4: Unified Dashboard View with Conditional Content ✅
**File**: `app/Views/auth/dashboard.php` (665 lines)
- ✅ PHP conditional statements: `<?php if (($userRole ?? '') === 'admin'): ?>`
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Statistics cards, recent activities list
- ✅ **Teacher Dashboard**: Course management, add course modal, notifications
- ✅ **Student Dashboard**: Enrolled/available courses, deadlines, grades
- ✅ Role-based content display with proper styling
- ✅ AJAX functionality for course enrollment and creation

### Step 5: Dynamic Navigation Bar ✅
**File**: `app/Views/template/header.php` (68 lines)
- ✅ Role-specific navigation items accessible from anywhere

- ✅ Dashboard route: `$routes->get('/dashboard', 'Auth::dashboard');`
- ✅ Authentication routes: login, register, logout
- ✅ Course management routes for all roles
- ✅ Proper route organization and structure

### Step 7: Testing Ready ✅
**Test Accounts Available**:
- **Admin**: `admin@example.com` / `password`
